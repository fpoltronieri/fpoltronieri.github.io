I am an Assistant Professor (RTD-A) at the Department of Engineering, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy, where I received my Ph.D. in Information Engineering in 2021.

My research focuses on distributed systems, network and service management, and related fields. I collaborate with national and international institutions on topics including Value-of-Information, Digital Twins, optimization techniques for service orchestration and management, tactical communications, and the exploitation of IoT in civilian and military domains.

I was a visiting researcher at the Florida Institute for Human & Machine Cognition (IHMC) in Pensacola, USA, in 2016–2017 and 2018, where I worked under the supervision of Dr. Niranjan Suri. There, I conducted research to build communication solutions for tactical network environments.

I am an active member of the network and service management community and regularly attend flagship conferences such as IEEE/IFIP NOMS and CNSM.
